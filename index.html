        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Julia De Guzman. A little bit about me, I am 19 years old. I was originally named after the famous actress, Julia Roberts. My birthday is in March which makes me a pisces. I am originally from Rhode Island but I have been living in Yorba Linda, California for the past 8 years. I spent some of my adolescence in the Philippines. I was given the opportunity to study there for 4 years. I have a little sister and a dog.My mom is one of six siblings so I have a very big family. I grew up very close to my cousins. We all ended up living in the same city going to the same school. When I was younger I did many sports, I was a figure skater, I did gymnastics and cheerleading and I also danced. In high school I was on the cheerleader team and was active in many clubs such as, medical club and red cross club. I also took a culinary classes in school which then I learned I also have an interest in cooking and baking. In my free time I love to hangout with my family and friends as well as going to the beach, cooking, baking and even hanging out with my dog. I also worked at Baskin Robbins and spent my time doing service hours at church.<br><br>

        I am very passionate about health and fitness. I believe being healthy and eating healthy is very important. After school I usually like to go to the gym or for a walk. Music is also very important to me. I think it really helps me relax as well as generally improve my well being. I do want to get into singing. I have always wanted to take singing lessons or classes. During my last 2 years of high school I started to take pre medical classes. In my senior year of high school I started my EMT ROP classes. During the next few years I want to achieve my EMT license and as well as start a career as an EMT.<br><br>

        In my first year of college I also joined the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, Epsilon Pi chapter. I believe that greek life is a great way to meet new people, gain new experiences and leadership skills and to build long lasting relationships and connections. I also enjoy participating in social events and philanthropic activities. At the University of California, Riverside I am a Public Policy major and I soon want to go in the direction of Public Health. Growing up I have had an interest in dancing so therefore right now I am also taking a dance class for fun and also a breath class. In the next couple of years I would also love to start taking psychology classes so that in the future I can possibly minor in Psychology. After college I would like to apply for Physcian Assistant School and work in a private practice.
